Accessing our posterior samples
===============================

As part of this data release, we include 3 files,

* `Nature.xxx.yyy.2022-v1-GW200129_065458_PEDataRelease.h5`
    * This file contains posterior samples obtained in our analysis of GW200129_065458. We store the posterior samples with the label :code:`C01:NRSur7dq4`.

* `Nature.xxx.yyy.2022-v1-GW200129_065458_VaryingDetectorNetwork.h5`
    * This file contains posterior samples obtained in our analysis of GW200129_065458 for different detector networks. The :code:`HLV` dataset presents the posterior samples obtained for a LIGO-Hanford, LIGO-Livingston and Virgo detector network, :code:`HV` for a LIGO-Hanford and Virgo detector network and :code:`LV` for a LIGO-Livingston and Virgo detector network.

* `Nature.xxx.yyy.2022-v1-GW200129_065458_ZeroNoiseInjection.h5`
    * This file contains posterior samples obtained when analysing a theoretical signal from a precessing binary with our best-estimate parameters of GW200129_065458 (i.e. those with the maximum likelihood in our analysis) as it would be observed in a network of detectors with the same frequency-dependent sensitivity, but with no noise. The :code:`HLV` dataset presents the posterior samples obtained for a LIGO-Hanford, LIGO-Livingston and Virgo detector network, :code:`HV` for a LIGO-Hanford and Virgo detector network and :code:`LV` for a LIGO-Livingston and Virgo detector network.

.. note::

    Both files contain posterior samples obtained with the :code:`NRSur7dq4`
    waveform model.

Our posterior samples are stored on `Zenodo <https://zenodo.org/>`_. To
download our posterior samples,

.. tabbed:: Python

    we recommend using
    `PESummary <https://lscsoft.docs.ligo.org/pesummary/stable_docs/installation.html>`_
    We can download and read the files with the following,

    .. code-block:: python

        from pesummary.core.fetch import download_and_read_file
        data = download_and_read_file(
            "https://www.google.co.uk",
            read_file=True,
            delete_on_exit=False,
            outdir="./",
            download_kwargs={"timeout": 60},
        )
        print(data)

    The files are then downloaded into your current working directory and the
    posterior samples can be accessed via the :code:`data` object.

.. tabbed:: bash

    we recommend using :code:`zendo_get`:

    .. code-block:: bash

        pip install zenodo_get
        zenodo-get XXX

    This will download both files included in this data release. To download a
    single file, we recommend using :code:`cURL`,

    .. code-block:: bash

        curl 


Both sets of posterior samples are formatted using
`PESummary <https://lscsoft.docs.ligo.org/pesummary/index.html>`_.
