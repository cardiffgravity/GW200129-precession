This page contains the data release associated with the publication
`Measurement of general-relativistic precession in a black-hole binary <https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.11300>`_
from Hannam, M. *et al.* In this publication we show that one of the events in the
`most recent LIGO-Virgo-Kagra (LVK) data release <https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.03606>`_
exhibits general relativistic orbital precession. The event is GW200129_065458.

Here, we release the posterior samples (:code:`*.h5`) that were obtained in this
analysis. The gravitational-wave strain data, power spectral densitites and
calibration envelopes can all be accessed via the Gravitational Wave Open
Science Center (https://www.gw-openscience.org), a service of LIGO Laboratory,
the LIGO Scientific Collaboration and the Virgo Collaboration. To access
these files see,
